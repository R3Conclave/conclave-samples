# CorDapp Sample - Java

This is a simple CorDapp using the Conclave API. It is licensed under the Apache 2 license, and therefore you 
may copy/paste it to act as the basis of your own commercial or open source apps.

## Usage

Unlike most CorDapps this one will *only run on Linux* due to the need for an enclave. But don't fear: you can use 
virtualisation to run it on Windows and macOS as well. For Windows and macOS, this will unfortunately require you to
do some manual work to set up a docker container (instructions below).

### Linux

1. Download and unpack JDK 8 and set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point it.
2. Run `./gradlew workflows:test`

### macOS

1. Download and install Docker Desktop if it isn't installed already. Ensure that it is running.
2. Download and unpack JDK 11 (LTS) and set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to it. If you're already using 
   versions 8 to 12 then you can skip this step.
3. Create and enter the Linux execution environment:
   ```
   ./gradlew enclave:setupLinuxExecEnvironment
   docker run -it --rm -v ${HOME}:/home/${USER} -w /home/${USER} conclave-build /bin/bash
   ```
   This will mount your home directory and give you a Linux shell.
4. Run the following command to setup JDK 8 inside the Linux environment:
   ```
   apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk-headless && export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```
5. Change directory to your project and run the project as you would under Linux:
    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ./gradlew workflows:test
    ```

### Windows

1. Download and install Docker Desktop if it isn't installed already. Ensure that it is running.
2. Download and unpack JDK 11 (LTS) and set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point it. If you're already using
   versions 8 to 12 then you can skip this step.
3. Create and enter the Linux execution environment:
    ```
    .\gradlew.bat enclave:setupLinuxExecEnvironment
    docker run -it --rm -v ${HOME}:/home/${env:UserName} -w /home/${env:UserName} conclave-build /bin/bash
    ```
    This will mount your user directory and give you a Linux shell.
4. Run the following command to setup JDK 8 inside the Linux environment:
   ```
   apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk-headless && export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```
5. Change directory to your project and run the project as you would under Linux:
    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ./gradlew workflows:test
    ```

Alternatively, ubuntu 20.04 via WSL 2 ([Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
may also prove to work for you, though this has not been extensively tested.

For an explanation of the Docker command used above, see
[the tutorials](https://docs.conclave.net/running-hello-world.html#appendix-summary-of-docker-command-options).

## Corda Node Identity Validation
The [certificates](certificates) folder contains the truststore.jks Java KeyStore that contains the Corda Root
certificate authority (CA) public key that can be used for development or testing purposes. It is used to generate 
the trustedroot.cer that is then embedded as a resource in the enclave, and used to validate a Corda node's identity 
when a message is relayed from the host to the enclave.

To learn more about root certificates in the Corda network, please refer to
[the Corda documentation](https://docs.r3.com/en/platform/corda/4.8/open-source/permissioning.html).

The public Corda Network Root Certificate can be found at https://trust.corda.network/.

### Usage
Use the shell script `dmp-cordarootca.sh` to dump the Root CA cert, then copy and paste the
output to the cordapp/enclave/src/main/resources/trustedroot.cer. *Note that this has been already
done for you, and is reported here only for documentation purpose*.

```shell
cordapp/certificates> ./dump-cordarootca.sh

### Note on conclave modes
By default, this sample will build and run in [mock mode](https://docs.conclave.net/mockmode.html), and so won't use a
secure enclave. For a list of modes and their properties, see [here](https://docs.conclave.net/enclave-modes.html).
For instructions on how to set the mode at build time, see [here](https://docs.conclave.net/running-hello-world.html#beyond-mock-mode)
